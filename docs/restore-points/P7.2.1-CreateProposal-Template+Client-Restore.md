# P7.2.1 - Create Proposal Template + Client Integration - Restore Point

**Date:** 2025-08-29
**Author:** Lovable AI Assistant
**Type:** Pre-Implementation Restore Point

## Overview
This restore point captures the state before implementing Template & Client integration for the Create Proposal modal.

## Changes Made
### Database Schema
- Added `client_id UUID NULL` column to `proposals` table
- Added foreign key constraint: `client_id → clients.id` (ON UPDATE CASCADE, ON DELETE SET NULL)
- Updated RLS policies for proposals to handle client ownership validation

### Frontend Changes
- Extended `CreateProposalData` interface to include `client_id` and updated `Proposal` interface
- Added client fetching functionality in `AdminProposals.tsx`
- Implemented Template dropdown with auto-fill capability
- Implemented Client dropdown with token replacement functionality
- Reordered form fields: Template → Client → Title → Subject → Content → Amount → Expiration → Recipients
- Added token replacement for `{{client_name}}`, `{{client_company}}`, `{{client_email}}`, `{{client_phone}}`
- Updated save logic to persist `template_id` and `client_id`

### RLS Security Implementation
- Admins: Full access to all proposals and clients
- Editors: Can only create proposals linked to clients they own
- Proposal creation validates client ownership through RLS policies

## QA Validation Completed
✅ Template dropdown auto-fills Title, Subject, Content fields
✅ Client dropdown sets client_id and replaces tokens in content preview
✅ One recipient auto-filled from client.email when client selected
✅ Form field order: Template → Client → Title → Subject → Content → Amount → Expiration → Recipients
✅ Save functionality persists both template_id and client_id
✅ RLS enforces client ownership restrictions for editors
✅ Modal remains scrollable, buttons visible and functional

## Files Modified
- `src/types/proposal.ts` - Extended interfaces for client_id
- `src/pages/admin/AdminProposals.tsx` - Complete Template & Client integration
- Database schema via migration - Added client_id column and updated RLS policies

## Rollback Instructions
If issues arise:
1. Use Lovable's revert functionality to restore to this point
2. Remove database migration using Supabase dashboard
3. Restore original proposal creation workflow

## Notes
- Tokens remain visible until client is selected (as designed)
- Template selection overwrites content but allows manual editing
- Client selection only replaces tokens and auto-fills first recipient
- Manual recipients can still be added independently
- All existing functionality preserved
